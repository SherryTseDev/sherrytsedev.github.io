  <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a legal agreement between you ("User") and the developer SherryTse governing your use of the Parallel Hub mobile application and related services. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Service description</h2>
  <p>Parallel Hub provides multi‑instance/multi‑account management tools. We may modify, update, limit, or discontinue features at any time without prior notice. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>You must not use the App to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
    <li>Infringe others' intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.</li>
    <li>Distribute unlawful, obscene, violent, or hateful content.</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse‑engineer, tamper with, or undermine App security.</li>
    <li>Use the App for fraud, harassment, or other malicious purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. User responsibility</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of accounts you access using the App and for any actions taken with those accounts. Using multi‑instance features may carry risks (such as account restrictions or bans imposed by third‑party platforms); you accept these risks.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>All intellectual property rights in the App (including code, design, graphics, and trademarks) remain with the developer or its licensors. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works without explicit permission.</p>

  <h2>6. Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>The App may link to or integrate third‑party services. Your use of third‑party services is governed by their terms and policies. We are not responsible for third‑party content or actions.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimers and limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available." To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties—express or implied—including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>8. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you breach these Terms, for safety or legal reasons, or for maintenance. Upon termination, any permitted license ends and you must stop using the App.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the revised Terms in the App or other reasonable channels. Continued use after the posting constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>10. Governing law and disputes</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws applicable to the developer's jurisdiction. Disputes should first be attempted to be resolved through good‑faith negotiation; if negotiation fails, you may pursue remedies available under applicable law and jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact:<br>
