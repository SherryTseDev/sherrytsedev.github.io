  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains how Parallel Hub ("we", "us", "the App") collects, uses, stores, and discloses information when you use the App. By installing or using Parallel Hub you agree to the terms described below.</p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Device and technical information</h3>
  <p>We may collect non-personal device data required to operate and improve the App, such as device model, operating system version, language, unique device identifiers (e.g., Android ID), and network status.</p>

  <h3>2.2 Usage data</h3>
  <p>We collect analytics and diagnostic data including feature usage, crash reports, performance metrics, and aggregated interaction data. This information is used to maintain and enhance the App; it does not identify you personally.</p>

  <h3>2.3 Third‑party services</h3>
  <p>We may use third‑party SDKs and services (for analytics, crash reporting, or ads). Those services may collect device and usage data under their own policies. We select partners that comply with applicable laws.</p>

  <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain App functions (including multi-instance features).</li>
    <li>To diagnose and fix technical issues and crashes.</li>
    <li>To analyze and improve product performance and user experience.</li>
    <li>To detect and prevent abuse and secure the App.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information.</p>

  <h2>4. Data storage and security</h2>
  <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes in this policy. We apply reasonable technical and administrative safeguards (such as access controls and encryption when appropriate) to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction.</p>

  <h2>5. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not share personal data except as described below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With your consent.</li>
    <li>With service providers who help operate the App (they process data on our behalf).</li>
    <li>When required by law, to respond to lawful requests, or to protect our rights and users' safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on local law, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or request portability of personal data we hold about you, and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. Exercising these rights may limit some App functionality.</p>

  <h2>7. Minors</h2>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or lower age where local law requires). If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child provided us with personal data, please contact us.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will publish changes in the App or via other reasonable notice. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, requests, or concerns regarding this policy, contact:<br>
